## Cart and Checkout

Cart and checkout services provide lightweight functionality to handle cart operations and the ability to convert those into orders through a checkout process. This differs from a commerce service or platform that provides a broader set of commerce features such as catalog, order management, promotions, and more. A decoupled cart and checkout service is agnostically designed to digest products from a variety of different sources and should seamlessly integrate with any payment gateway, shipping methods, tax calculation, and promotion APIs. A cart and checkout service does not provide a fully-featured Order Management System (OMS).
